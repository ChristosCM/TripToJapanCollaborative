# TripToJapanCollaborative
trip
Report part1 
My team and I have been working on the problem widely known as TripToJapan.
The task at hand is to create a program that will create for 20 users the perfect trip to japan, taking into account the way, purpose, duration, cost of the trip.
After the the trip the users are asked to rate their journey in a scale of 1 to 3(1 is least pleased and 3 is most). So far the flowchart has been completed and the tasks have been deligated.
The second part of te program(rating the trip) has been completed, generating a graph from the data collected from the users while saving the image of the graph as well.
In the planning of the trip, my higly trained team has generated random testcases in order to make testing easier. Those, randomly select the answers to the above questions(budget,way of travelling etc.) and create lists that are gonna be used for the actual program.
